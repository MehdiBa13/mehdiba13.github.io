	<h1>// About me</h1>
	<p class="post">On Friday, August 4th, 2023</p>
	<p>Hey everyone, this is a post I made where I'll talk a little bit about myself and
	   about my interests.</p>
	<h2>$~ whoami</h2>
	<p>
		- I'm Mehdi, a 13 years old boy, and I live in Morocco.
	</p>
	<h2>$~ cat interests.txt</h2>
	<p>
		- STEM has always been my passion. I like sciences (maths, physics, chemistry, biology...)
		I also like technology, and programming (developing apps...). I also love computer science,
		and I participate in competitive programming contests. I'm interested in mythology as well,
		in greek and egyptian myths, and their stories about heroes and all that stuff.
